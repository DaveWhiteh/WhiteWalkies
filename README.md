### **Strategy**

**Site Goals**

This particular project is to design and create a static website that is done mainly through HTML and CSS.

The main goal for the website is to get potential customers to sign up to one or more of the services by getting them to contact the company. This will in turn not only provide an essential service to the user but also generate revenue for the business. 

The site from the off will need to be appealing in design so that it stands out and grabs the users attention which in turn will make them feel like they want to check out the rest of the site. Through making the site fully responsive and with a single page scroll navigation the site aims to be easily accessible no matter which platform the user is viewing the site on. 

The sites goal of "quality over quantity" means that the user gets just the right enough of information to digest, and with pleasantly pleasing images of happy dogs/puppies throughout the site, this will hopefully give the user a warm and confident feeling that they could potentially see their own dog/puppy being in the care of one of the trained staff members.

### **Scope**

The main features that will be implemented into the website will be included in six sections that will be navigated via a single scrollable page.

The design of the site should be friendly adopting a warm feeling throughout but also be eye catching enough as to stand out from the crowd in terms of other websites within the same industry. A colour palette was chosen and fonts selected at this point to help create this design.

**Homepage**

This will offer a stand out navigation bar that will be fixed to top so when scrolling through the site the user at any point can skip or go back to certain sections on the page. The hero image will be a video that is a looping 30 secs clip of the dogs on the walk, this will only be a video on desktop's and will change to an image on both tablet and mobile devices. This is so that we make sure load times on smaller devices are kept as low as possible and that we don't use too much of the users data.

**About Us**

We will use warm neutral colours with this section that will ultimately give the user a small but informative insight into the business, who we are, where we operate and what we offer.

**Pet Services**

This section will contain small descriptive paragraphs, as well as some pleasing imagery that will give the user an explanation of the services that the company offers.

**Prices**

This is where we contain the pricing and what is actually included in that price for each service. This is an important section that provides essential information. We don't want to overwhelm the user so we include only the information that is relevant in a clear format that easy to digest. We could also add some stand out information that reassures and lets the user know that the staff are fully compliant and have checks in place.

**Gallery**

This section will showcase some of the images of the dogs/puppies and will be flickable from either the left or right. This section will also include a video that will enhance the user experience by giving them a visual insight into how much fun there dog/puppy could be having with WhiteWalkies.

**Contact**

This will be where the user inputs there relevant information where they will be able to get in touch with the company. It will also contain a map indicating where the company is actually located.

**Footer**

The footer should stand out like the nav bar and will contain all the social media links for the user to be able to just click and be taken to the relevant page. It will also contain the opening times for the company, the address and contact telephone numbers which is another form in which the user could contact the company. These three parts will have icons above them which will allow the user to easily identify one of the parts before actually reading should they just want to look for that part of the footer.

**Thankyou**

A thankyou page is essential for site branding. The user will be re-located after they submit their message in the contact section. The page will contain a simple, short message that shows the appreciation from the site owner to the user for getting in touch. It will contain both the header and footer and also a link that gets them back to the homepage.

### **Structure**

The structure of the site consists of a single scrollable page rather than multiple separate pages. This should give a more accessible experience for all and by doing so will adopt a more mobile-first design which is how the majority of people view websites these days. This approach also provides less steps for the user which will hopefully minimise the risk of the user losing interest.

The single page will be made up of the Header and Footer as well six main sections, Homepage, About Us, Pet Services, Prices, Gallery and Contact. Each section will be clearly identified using design elements. They will have a bold heading that will be clear and concise, with text that is informative and intuitive, both of which will conform to the accessibility standards. Images where necessary will be relevant to that part of the section. We also want to offer the user the opportunity to get in touch at every section on the page when navigating through, so there will be a button that will allow the user to go straight to the contact section.

The header will be designed in a way that captivates the user with the use of good colour combinations. It will consist of the company logo and a nav section which will be text on desktop and then be a list with a hamburger icon for smaller devices.

In the middle part of the single scrollable page there will be an image which will act as a breather for the user that will be a fixed background image. On the top and the bottom of this image there will be a banner that will stand out and catch the users eye. The top banner will have some icons that will immediately appeal to the user with some clearly stated text about the company. The bottom banner will be short and provide the social media links for the user to click on.

The footer will use the same colour combination as the header and will contain the social media links and relevant business information, opening hours, address and telephone numbers. These will have icons above them to capture the user's attention and to indicate the information that is displayed.

### **Skeleton**

The design tool figma was used to create the wireframes which are an initial outlay of the layout of the site. There were three frames created. Each frame representing a different device and each frame measured in pixels. This was done to show the responsiveness of the layout on different devices.

Desktop (1920 x 1080)<br>
Tablet (1024 x 1366)<br>
Mobile (393 x 852)

The wireframes were then built on by creating an actual fully designed site using the colour palette, fonts and images that were selected when initially scoping out the site. Planning and being as prepared as possible was the key reason for generating the full designs using figma.

Having the design already laid out with the bulk of the main elements, like which colours work well together, which elements were coloured what, which font to use for what text, which images to use and where they are placed, having all these factors planned out makes the coding of the site easier to focus on and more straightforward.

### **Surface**

**Colour**

The colours within the chosen palette work well together. They were chosen using the site [color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/17298). They contain neutral sandy colours, which give a sense of warmth and comfort to the user when scrolling through the main bulk of the sections. The palette then contains the black and pink which are used on parts of the site that require a more commanding presence, that allows them to stand out and keep the user engaged. The pink also portrays the sense of love and fun which are two of the biggest emotions that people think of when they are around there dog/puppy.

![Colour Palette](assets/images/readme/colour-palette.jpg)

Tints and Shades of these colours are used also and are created using the site [maketintsandshade.com](https://maketintsandshades.com/#CC007A,F5D59A,575757).

**Typography**

The font Poppins was chosen for the headers and the text that required more prominence. To find a font that would be used for the main body of the text was done via an online pairing tool called [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/pairings/poppins-lora). Both these fonts are available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

**Images**

The images have been chosen carefully and where necessary reflect the description of the text that goes with them. The images are all of dog/puppies and they are all of a happy nature set in different environments, this portrays the variation of walks that they get to experience and that the user can easily relate to. The video has been selected to give the user a more in depth vision of what they can expect when their dog is in the care and supervision one of the trained dog/puppy walkers. All the individual images and video sources can be found in the [credits](#credits) section.

**Icons**

The icons used are all found at Font Awesome. Having icons as the social media links immediately allows the user to easily identify which social media platform is which. The icons on the footer used to identify the opening hours, address and telephone numbers are all easily appealing on the eye for the user.
